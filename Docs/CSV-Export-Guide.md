# Export Guide for Security Reports

## Overview

The CSVActiveDirectory module supports multiple export formats for security reports and IoC detection results:

1. **CSV Export** - For data analysis and SIEM integration

#### **üî¥ CRITICAL RISKS**
- **PrivilegeEscalation** - Privileged account password changes, service accounts with admin rights
- **Reconnaissance** - Suspicious account naming patterns
- **Other** - Standard critical risks (failed password attempts, etc.)

#### **üü° HIGH RISKS**
- **SuspiciousAuth** - Failed attempts followed by successful logon
- **ServiceAccountAbuse** - Service accounts active during off-hours
